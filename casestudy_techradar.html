                    I was tasked with analyzing an existing news website 
                    and employing heuristic analysis to identify its 
                    weaknesses.

                <p class= "secondparagraph">
                    Then, using mobile-first design philosophy, I would
                    redesign the site at the three major breakpoints
                    (Mobile, Tablet, & Desktop) with advertisement content 
                    factored in. I chose Techradar.com because I felt that 
                    my personality made up a good portion of the user base 
                    and that it would be easy to come up with an effective 
                    site redesign.

                    My first step in this process was to “map out” the
                     current organization of Techradar.com. I accomplished
                    this by:

                <p class= "secondparagraph">
                    The goal of this exercise was to gain insights

                    From Techradar's advertisement media kit, I was able to
                    cultivate an idea of the site's current audience and 
                    constructed a preliminary user persona so I could get
                    a better sense of who I was redesigning the site for. 
                    Through my research, I determined that my average user 
                    was:

                    Next, I set out to identify the key problems within 
                    Techradar.com's design. These factors were based on a 
                    heuristic analysis I performed on the site. The main 
                    problems I identified as a result of this assessment 
                    were that:
                </p>
                <ul class= "casestudy_list">
                    <li>
                        Ads were sometimes intrusive and were often put 
                        first over content, 
                        often taking away from the actual site
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Navigational menu wasn't intuitive which made 
                        navigating the actual site cumbersome
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The site lacked any Help and Feedback pages/forms
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The visual design was much to be desired and overall
                        “uninspiring” or engaging to users
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    After finishing my initial breakdown of Techradar.com, 
                    I laid out my goals that I would focus on in my 
                    redesign. My main focuses included:

                <ul class= "casestudy_list">
                    <li>

                        cumbersome to navigate the actual site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Changing advertisement placement/format so that ads
                        are no longer intrusive or dominating over actual
                        site content
                    </li>
                    <li>Overhauling the visual design to give the site a

                <p>
                    My first step in designing my actual site revolved 
                    around rough wireframe sketches. These drawings weren't
                    about detail and their primary goal revolved around 
                    me getting my initial layout ideas onto a physical space.

            <div class= "casestudy_textcontainer">
                <p>
                    Next, I consolidated a color palette that would be used 
                    in my redesign. While selecting a new palette I tried to
                    shift the color scheme of the existing brand, while not 
                    abandoning the original colors completely.

                    After color selection, I then played around with

                    I was very happy how my final site redesign turned out. 
                    At the very least, I believe I addressed all the 
                    heuristic problems present in Techradar.com's current 
                    design. I felt that I made constructive and effective 
                    decisions that gave my final redesign a fresh new look
                     on what Techradar.com could potentially look like.
