                    This was a color exercise I did for my Design for Media 2 
                    class. I took a portrait image of something I liked (I used 
                    a still of Han Solo), and traced over it it with triangular
                    shapes of varying sizes over the colors of the image. After
                    doing this, I then filled all the shapes in with colors of 
                    the majority pixel type in the set triangle area, creating
                    the image you see now. Its a neat effect right?
