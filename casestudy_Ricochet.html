                    At the beginning of Fall 2021, I was approached by
                    an upperclassman from Drexel's business college inquiring 
                    about possible work I could do for his start-up company; 
                    Ricochet Exchange. Ricochet Exchange is a cryptocurrency 
                    streaming company that hosts a digital interface where users 
                    can continuously invest money into and out of different 
                    cryptocurrencies in real time. What started as working on 
                    some preliminary web work, led to about three months of me
                    completing a myriad of design, animation, and graphic project
                    the company.

                    The main project I worked on during my time with Ricochet 
                    was redesigning their landing page website for desktop and
                    mobile. The original site was poorly deisgned and my client 
                    wanted to update the aesthetic. My main priority in the redesign 
                    was to adjust the color and spacing choices to be more synergistic,
                    make some small (but important) content tweaks, and improve overall 
                    flow/feel of their site. While the site has since changed since my
                    departure, my inital layout marked an important starting point for 
                    future development

                    While my main project was redesigning Ricochet’s Website
                    on the side I did a good amount of graphic design work for 
                    the company. These assignments included: Slideshow Template 
                    Designs, Title headers, collaboration mock-ups, and a bit of 
                    video editing, all of which were used in company presentations 
                    and community calls.

                        While I was sad to see my time end at Ricochet after the completion 
                        of our work together, I really enjoyed my time working part-time for
                        the company. I got to “wear many hats” while working for Ricochet 
                        and it was really satisfying to challenge myself on so many different
                        types of design work within my field.
