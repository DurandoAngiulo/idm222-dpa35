                    For my final project for Design for Media 1, I was 
                    tasked with creating a moving black and white image.
                    I chose to create a 2D animation for my final project.

                    Before I even started animating anything, I had to come up 
                    with a story that would serve as the focus of my animation. 
                    This was tricky because I had to design a plot that was 
                    short enough that I would have enough time to animate, 
                    but also long enough to be interesting and engaging to 
                    audiences.

                <p class= "secondparagraph">
                    At the time of this project, I had recently finished 
                    playing a video game called “The Ghost of Tsushima”. 
                    Within the game, there were moments called “Standoffs” 
                    where the player would face down an opponent and finish 
                    them in one blow. I decided to design my story around 
                    this idea.

                    Next I began creating concept art for my characters in 
                    their respective scenes and gathering reference material 
                    for posing. Having that visual content to reference and
                    use as templates proved to be extremely helpful during 
                    the course of the project.

                    Now that I had everything prepped, I actually had to… 
                    animate my story.  Prior to this assignment. I had zero
                    prior experience doing animation of any kind.
                </p> 
                <p class= "secondparagraph">
                    So I did what anyone who needed to learn how to do 
                    something new did: go to YouTube. I eventually settled
                    on using Adobe Animate to do my animation because it 
                    wasn't an extreme learning curve and it had plenty of 
                    tutorials from both Adobe and community creators.
                </p>   
                <p class= "secondparagraph">
                    As I worked through animating my scenes, I purely focused on 
                    animating the motions that would be taking place in each scene. 
                    I did things this way so I could get a rough version of 
                    all my animations done and so I could focus purely on 
                    refining things and adding detail the next time around.

                <p>
                    Next, I went back through all my completed scenes and 
                    tweaked motions and tried to heighten visual designs 
                    of characters and their scenes. I also used this step
                    to add smaller detailed animations into all my scenes,
                    giving the characters and their environments more
                    “life” and making them seem more interesting to look at.

                    After completely finishing my animation scenes, I then 
                    uploaded all my content into Adobe Premiere Pro for 
                    the editing process. It was here that I neatly strung 
                    all my content together and added some visual effects 
                    to improve the overall quality of my animation.

                    The last step I took towards completing my animation
                    was adding a dynamic score that complemented the story
                    I was trying to tell. Because I was running close to my deadline
                    at this point, I reached out to a family friend with experience 
                    in the area for his help and advice. After telling him what I 
                    was looking for in my score, he in turned helped me craft a 
                    dynamic composition that enhanced my animation that was adapted 
                    to my narrative.

                    I had a lot of fun working on this project. Of course 
                    never having animated before, this assignment often 
                    proved difficult and frustrating. However, it was a
                    rewarding experience and I learned a lot about the 
                    world of animation.
