            For this term-long project, I was a part of a team of 4 assigned
            with creating a functional web app prototype of a foodtruck ordering
            interface. Our team chose Kami Foodtruck, a truck specializing in
            Korean dishes, for our application. This prototype's goal would be
            to facilitate a user ordering a dish online then going to the truck to pick
            up their order.
          </p>

            For this project, our team was divided into different roles to
            tackle the variety of tasks that would need to be completed at the
            end of this assignment. My role was that of the back-end coder. This
            role meant I was responsible for all the backend programming that
            would make our web app actually functional. My main goals in this role
            were (but not limted to):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Setting up a database where all the visual and text content of our
              project would be hosted and queried.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creating a query system that allowed items a user ordered to be
              passed in and out the database dependant on where they were in the
              checkout procedure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implementing login functionality that would allow a guest to sign
              up/login to the application and transfer any cart items to the new
              logged in user.

            The first step of my role was to set up a databse
            where I could add, update, and query database items to the site. I
            first outlined a 4-table structure that would be able to handle all
            the elements and features I would ultimately be implementing in
            order to have a road map for future development. These tables
            included Orders, Cart items, Menu Items, and Users. I then used PHP,
            mySQl, and PHPMyAdmin to create the actual database tables, and
            inputted all of Kami's menu items into my database table structure.

            My next step in my backend fucntionality was to create a dynamic
            ordering system that would track what a user added to thier cart,
            how many of that particular item they added, and any other relevant
            information like spice level or protien choice. The next step would
            be to store this information in the database then be able to requery
            it correctly at the cart, checkout. and order confirmation pages.

          <p class="secondparagraph">
            To implement this feature I first created a function that on page
            load, a new order would be created that was tied to the current
            session user's id. I then wrote query functions that added items and
            their data as a cart item in the Cart Items table. These queries
            would tie every cart item created to the active order that was
            linked to the current session user's id. it was using this process
            that allowed me to store all relevant order data and reqery it later
            on in the checkout process.

            My last main step in my section of this project was to create a
            robust login system that would allow a guest to both signup/login as
            a user as well as have all the order data they made as a guest
            transfer over to thier new permenant user in the following checkout
            & order confirmation pages.
          </p>
          <p class="secondparagraph">
            To make this feature possible, I first created functionality that on
            page load, the app would check if a user existed in the databse that
            matched the currrent user. If this wasn't true (which would usually
            be the case), a guest user would be created to store all their order
            items. Next, after leaving the cart page to check out, the user
            would then be prompted to signup/login. Here, I created query
            functionality to add a new user to the database after they filled
            out the signup fields, and then corretcly log them in after they
            filled out the login fields. On login, I also added functionality
            that updated the newly logged in user's id with the guest's id instead. It
            was in this way that all the orders/cart items currently tied to the
            guest would then be transfered over to the new logged in user.
            Finally, to avoid errors, queried the database one last time to
            delete the guest user. it was by doing all this that allowed me to
            reach my goal of a dynamic login system.

            Overall I am quite happy with my team's final build of this application came out.
            We all worked really hard on this assignment, from user testing and design, to
            microinteractions and backend functionality. Every team member gave this project their
            all and while its not perfect, we as a group accomplished the goals we set to do at the start of this
            assignment.
            <p>
            I am also very proud of how my section itself came out.
            A lot of the coding I had to do over the course of this assignment was
            definitely a step above what I have been doing before with PHP and it was 
            often difficult to learn so many new techniques to accomplish my delieverables.
            but in the end, I persevered and was able to deliver fully wihtout significantly comprimising 
            my team's overall vision, which makes me pleased.
