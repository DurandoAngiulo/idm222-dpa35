                    This was a smaller freelance project I undertook. 
                    I was offered to design a website for a local residential 
                    electrician Company called JA Electric. The company was 
                    based on a referral system and wanted a website so they 
                    could expand their customer base.

                    I used SquareSpace to design and host this site. 
                    The software itself is simple to understand and 
                    made it easy for me to build the elements I wanted.
                </p> 
                <p class= "secondparagraph">
                    When actually designing the site, I opted to go for a 
                    clean, modern, visual aesthetic. I wanted a professional
                    feel behind the site so I kept things minimalist, 
                    but still tried to maintain engagement across the 
                    different pages.

                    The client and I were both really happy with how the 
                    final site turned out! The company now has a fully 
                    functioning site that promotes their business, and 
                    makes it easy to get in contact with them.
