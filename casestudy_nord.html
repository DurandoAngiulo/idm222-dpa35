                    I was assigned with picking an existing app I knew well and 
                    mapping out it's interaction flow. Then, I was tasked with 
                    completely rebranding my chosen app with a new name/logo and with
                    a newly designed/animated interaction flow that highlights it's 
                    primary purpose. I chose Nord VPN for my app because I use it often 
                    as a user and knew the ins and outs of the interface.

                    The first thing I did was mapping the sequence a user takes in order 
                    to complete Nord's  to connect to a VPN Server).
                    Taking this step helped me break down Nord’s UI interface, making 
                    it easy for me to discern what I would keep and what I would redesign
                    for my rebranded version.

                    Next I sought out to break down my task flow into the core micro 
                    interactions that occur when a user interacts with the interface.
                    This allowed me to gain further understanding about how the app 
                    actually flowed and provided me with inspiration on creating my own 
                    microinteractions at future steps of the process.

                    In the end, I settled on CloudCover VPN. I thought it was a clever 
                    analogy for what a VPN does(Gives you “cloudcover” from ISPs), and 
                    because I thought it would be fun to incorporate a weather motif 
                    into my designs and microinteractions.

                    towards my final UI that would be involved in my taskflow animation.

                    After finalizing my UI, I started designing the actual microinteractions 
                    that would be present in my taskflow animation. While some micro interactions were 
                    purely utilitarian, I really tried to embrace the motif of my rebranded 
                    app to both give it more of a personality and make interacting with it memorable & unique

                    This project was a lot of fun for me for two reasons. 
                    Firstly, this was my first assignment where I wasn’t 
                    redesigning an existing website/app and I loved the 
                    freedom I was given to complete rebrand an app and 
                    make it my own.
                </p>
                <p class= "secondparagraph"> 
                    Secondly, while using Adobe After Effects for the first
                    time presented a lot of challenges for me, I was super 
                    excited begin to learn my way through the software 
                    and use it to create something awesome. In the end, 
                    I am very proud of my final Taskflow animation. 
                    It looks and flows very naturally, all while maintaining
                    the artistic vision of what I set out to do with CloudCover 
                    VPN.
