                    Over the summer of 2021, I participated in Drexel's STAR 
                    Scholars program. Over the course of this paid internship, 
                    I served as the sole designer of the first iteration of a 
                    new Westphal College sub site who's goal was to highlight 
                    student and faculty projects int he field of Digital 
                    Cultural Heritage.

                    first sorted through all the visual and written assets 
                    that were to be included in the inital live iteration. 
                    Doing this helped effectively envision and brainstorm 
                    potential site flows and hierarchy based on what my 
                    faculty mentor/client wanted and what made the most
                    sense based off my experience and the site assets I 
                    was given.

                    WordPress was utilized to host and design this site 
                    so it could be integrated easily with other university 
                    sub sites. When choosing my overarching site theme, 
                    I picked a design that balanced strong navigational 
                    usability along with engaging colors and visuals.

                    The purpose of the site was obviously first and 
                    foremost to house Drexel projects and research in
                    the field of Digital Cultural Heritage. But just as 
                    important, this site's goal was also to showcase this 
                    incredible work done by faculty and students alike.

                    By the end of my summer program I had successfully completed 
                    the first iteration of the now live website. While the website 
                    is still not fully populated and is missing some future key features,
                    the groundwork has been laid and now serves as an important live 
                    demo of what the final product will be after its eventual completion.
